- **Dash Wisely**: Save fuel for emergency escapes when spotted
- **Fuel Management**: Stop in safe locations to regenerate fuel
- **Avoid Water**: Water slows movement by 50% - stay on land
- **Watch for Beacons**: When beacon activates, immediately relocate
- **Use Terrain**: Navigate through complex areas where jetpack users struggle
- **Stay Mobile**: Keep moving between hiding spots to avoid being cornered
- **Listen for ONI**: Watch for red markers approaching your location

### Core Game Mechanics

#### Fuel System

The fuel system creates strategic depth by forcing players to balance ability usage with recovery:

- **Maximum Fuel**: 100 units for all players
- **ONI Fuel Recovery**: 20 units/second on any surface (ground, rooftops, bridges)
- **Runner Fuel Recovery**: 20 units/second only when stationary on surfaces
- **Jetpack Consumption**: 30 units/second (ONI only)
- **Dash Consumption**: 25 units/second (Runners only)
- **Empty Fuel**: Abilities are disabled when fuel reaches zero

**Key Insight**: ONI can recover fuel while moving, but runners must stop to recover. This creates a risk/reward dynamic where runners must choose between staying mobile or recovering fuel.

#### Tagging Mechanics

- **Tag Range**: 1.5 units (close proximity required)
- **Instant Role Switch**: Tagged runner immediately becomes ONI with full abilities
- **Original ONI**: Becomes a runner and must now escape
- **Survival Time**: Recorded for each player from game start to when tagged
- **Multiple ONI**: As more players get tagged, multiple ONI hunt remaining runners

#### Visual Indicators

Players are marked with colored indicators for easy identification:

- **ONI Players**: Red cone marker above head
  - 90% opacity when moving
  - 50% opacity when stationary
  - Rotates continuously
- **Runners**: Green cone marker above head
  - 90% opacity when moving
  - 50% opacity when stationary
  - Rotates continuously
- **Beacon Active**: Bright yellow beam above all runners (visible to all players)
- **Spotted Indicator**: "Spotted!" message when ONI has line of sight to you

#### Environment Features

The procedurally generated city provides diverse tactical opportunities:

- **Buildings**: 60+ tall buildings with flat rooftops
  - Climbable via ladders
  - Provide hiding spots and vantage points
  - Create vertical gameplay opportunities
- **Houses**: 40+ smaller houses for ground-level cover
- **Roads**: Streets with moving cars
  - Cars cause knockback on collision
  - Create dynamic obstacles
- **River**: Water feature crossing the map
  - Slows movement by 50%
  - Disadvantages runners trying to escape
- **Bridges**: Safe crossing points over the river
- **Ladders**: Vertical climbing system for reaching rooftops
  - Switches to third-person camera while climbing
- **Map Boundaries**: 400x400 unit playable area (200 units from center)
- **Height Limit**: 100 units maximum altitude

#### Game Timer

- **Duration Options**: 3 minutes (180 seconds) or 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Timer Display**: Shows remaining time in HUD
- **Warning States**:
  - Normal: White text
  - Warning: Yellow text (under 60 seconds)
  - Danger: Red text (under 30 seconds)

### Winning Conditions

#### Runners Win If:

- At least one runner survives until timer reaches zero
- All surviving runners are ranked by survival time
- Longest survival time wins

#### ONI Wins If:

- All players become ONI before timer expires
- Last player to be tagged has the longest survival time

#### Results Screen

After each round:

- **Player Rankings**: Sorted by survival time (longest to shortest)
- **Winner Highlight**: Player with longest survival time
- **Status Display**: Shows if each player escaped or was tagged
- **Statistics Update**: Wins/losses recorded to persistent storage
- **Next Round**: Continue to next round or return to menu

### Statistics Tracking

The game tracks your performance across all sessions:

- **Games Played**: Total number of games completed
- **Wins**: Games where you had the longest survival time
- **Losses**: Games where you were tagged before the end
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of games won
- **Total Survival Time**: Cumulative time survived across all games
- **Longest Survival**: Your best single-game survival time
- **Average Survival**: Mean survival time per game

Statistics are stored locally and persist across sessions.

## Current Implementation Status

### What You Can Experience Now

JetOni is currently a **3D city exploration game with a complete menu system** that showcases the technical foundation for the planned multiplayer tag game. The current implementation demonstrates Reddit-native 3D capabilities with a fully functional game engine, procedurally generated city, player movement system, and prototype-styled UI.
