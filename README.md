A multiplayer 3D tag game built with Three.js and Devvit, running directly on Reddit. Players will navigate a futuristic city environment in first-person view, chasing or evading each other in an intense game of tag with jetpacks, dash abilities, and strategic beacon powers.

## What is JetOni?

JetOni („Ç∏„Çß„ÉÉ„ÉàÈ¨º) is a Reddit-native 3D game project that demonstrates the technical foundation for building complex 3D games directly within Reddit posts using the Devvit platform. Currently, it features an **interactive 3D Earth demo** that showcases WebGL rendering, real-time state persistence, and precise 3D interaction mechanics.

**Planned Full Game:** An immersive 3D multiplayer tag game where one player starts as the "ONI" (demon/È¨º) and must tag other players to convert them. The last player remaining untagged wins! The game will combine traditional Japanese tag games with futuristic parkour mechanics in a fully 3D urban environment.

### Key Features (Planned)

- **First-Person 3D Gameplay**: Experience the thrill of chase and escape from a first-person perspective with full 360¬∞ camera control
- **Procedurally Generated City**: Navigate through a massive city with 60+ buildings, 40+ houses, roads, rivers, and bridges spanning a 400x400 unit map
- **Asymmetric Abilities**: ONI players fly with jetpacks while runners dash at high speeds - each role requires different strategies
- **Strategic Fuel Management**: Every ability consumes fuel that regenerates differently based on your role and actions
- **Beacon Tracking System**: ONI players can activate a powerful beacon to reveal all runner locations for 10 seconds
- **AI-Powered Opponents**: Games automatically fill with intelligent AI players that chase, flee, and use abilities strategically
- **Bilingual Support**: Full English and Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û) language support with instant switching
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Touch controls and responsive design for mobile devices
- **Scalable Matches**: Support for 4 to 20 players with customizable round durations (3 or 5 minutes)

## What Makes JetOni Innovative?

   - Runners only regenerate when stationary on surfaces
   - Forces strategic decision-making: move or recover?
   - Jetpack consumes 30 units/second, dash consumes 25 units/second

3. **Cascading Role Dynamics**
   - Tagged players instantly become ONI with full abilities
   - Original ONI becomes a runner and must now escape
   - Creates unpredictable gameplay where hunters become hunted
   - Survival time tracked for competitive leaderboards

4. **Tactical Beacon Ability**
   - 30-second initial delay after becoming ONI
   - Reveals all runner positions for 10 seconds
   - 30-second cooldown between uses
   - Must be used strategically to corner hidden players

5. **Full 3D Urban Parkour**
   - Climb buildings using ladders
   - Jump across rooftops
   - Cross rivers via bridges
   - Navigate through alleys and streets
   - Water slows movement by 50%

### Gameplay Guide (Coming Soon)

#### Playing as ONI (Demon/È¨º)

**Objective:** Tag all runners before the timer reaches zero

**Your Advantages:**
- **Jetpack Flight**: Hold SPACE to fly in any direction
  - Consumes 30 fuel/second while active
  - Provides vertical mobility to reach rooftops
  - Can fly over obstacles and water
- **Speed Boost**: Move 1.5x faster than runners (15 units/second)
- **Fuel Recovery**: Regenerate 20 fuel/second on any surface (ground, rooftops, bridges)
- **Beacon Ability**: Press B to reveal all runner locations
  - Available 30 seconds after becoming ONI
  - Shows yellow beams above all runners for 10 seconds
  - 30-second cooldown between uses

**Winning Strategies:**
- **Height Advantage**: Use jetpack to reach rooftops and scan for runners
- **Beacon Timing**: Activate beacon when runners are hidden to locate them
- **Fuel Management**: Land on surfaces to regenerate fuel before chasing
- **Corner Tactics**: Drive runners toward water or map edges where they're slower
- **Target Priority**: Chase the closest visible runner first
- **Predict Movement**: Anticipate where runners will flee and cut them off

**What Happens When You Tag Someone:**
- Tagged player instantly becomes ONI with full abilities
- You become a runner and must now escape
- Your survival time is recorded for the leaderboard

#### Playing as Runner (Escaping/ÈÄÉ„Åí„ÇãÂÅ¥)

**Objective:** Survive until the timer reaches zero without being tagged

**Your Advantages:**
- **Dash Ability**: Hold SHIFT to sprint at high speed
  - Increases speed to 20 units/second (2x normal speed)
  - Consumes 25 fuel/second while active
  - Perfect for quick escapes
- **Jump**: Press SPACE to jump over obstacles (no fuel cost)
- **Fuel Recovery**: Regenerate 20 fuel/second when stationary on surfaces
  - Must stop moving to recover fuel
  - Creates risk/reward decision: move or recover?

**Survival Strategies:**
- **Stay Hidden**: Use buildings, alleys, and structures for cover
- **Vertical Escape**: Climb ladders to reach rooftops and hide
- **Dash Wisely**: Save fuel for emergency escapes when spotted
- **Fuel Management**: Stop in safe locations to regenerate fuel
- **Avoid Water**: Water slows movement by 50% - stay on land
- **Watch for Beacons**: When beacon activates, immediately relocate
- **Use Terrain**: Navigate through complex areas where jetpack users struggle
- **Stay Mobile**: Keep moving between hiding spots to avoid being cornered
- **Listen for ONI**: Watch for red markers approaching your location

### Core Game Mechanics

#### Fuel System

The fuel system creates strategic depth by forcing players to balance ability usage with recovery:

- **Maximum Fuel**: 100 units for all players
- **ONI Fuel Recovery**: 20 units/second on any surface (ground, rooftops, bridges)
- **Runner Fuel Recovery**: 20 units/second only when stationary on surfaces
- **Jetpack Consumption**: 30 units/second (ONI only)
- **Dash Consumption**: 25 units/second (Runners only)
- **Empty Fuel**: Abilities are disabled when fuel reaches zero

**Key Insight**: ONI can recover fuel while moving, but runners must stop to recover. This creates a risk/reward dynamic where runners must choose between staying mobile or recovering fuel.

#### Tagging Mechanics

- **Tag Range**: 1.5 units (close proximity required)
- **Instant Role Switch**: Tagged runner immediately becomes ONI with full abilities
- **Original ONI**: Becomes a runner and must now escape
- **Survival Time**: Recorded for each player from game start to when tagged
- **Multiple ONI**: As more players get tagged, multiple ONI hunt remaining runners

#### Visual Indicators

Players are marked with colored indicators for easy identification:

- **ONI Players**: Red cone marker above head
  - 90% opacity when moving
  - 50% opacity when stationary
  - Rotates continuously
- **Runners**: Green cone marker above head
  - 90% opacity when moving
  - 50% opacity when stationary
  - Rotates continuously
- **Beacon Active**: Bright yellow beam above all runners (visible to all players)
- **Spotted Indicator**: "Spotted!" message when ONI has line of sight to you

#### Environment Features

The procedurally generated city provides diverse tactical opportunities:

- **Buildings**: 60+ tall buildings with flat rooftops
  - Climbable via ladders
  - Provide hiding spots and vantage points
  - Create vertical gameplay opportunities
- **Houses**: 40+ smaller houses for ground-level cover
- **Roads**: Streets with moving cars
  - Cars cause knockback on collision
  - Create dynamic obstacles
- **River**: Water feature crossing the map
  - Slows movement by 50%
  - Disadvantages runners trying to escape
- **Bridges**: Safe crossing points over the river
- **Ladders**: Vertical climbing system for reaching rooftops
  - Switches to third-person camera while climbing
- **Map Boundaries**: 400x400 unit playable area (200 units from center)
- **Height Limit**: 100 units maximum altitude

#### Game Timer

- **Duration Options**: 3 minutes (180 seconds) or 5 minutes (300 seconds)
- **Timer Display**: Shows remaining time in HUD
- **Warning States**:
  - Normal: White text
  - Warning: Yellow text (under 60 seconds)
  - Danger: Red text (under 30 seconds)

### Winning Conditions

#### Runners Win If:
- At least one runner survives until timer reaches zero
- All surviving runners are ranked by survival time
- Longest survival time wins

#### ONI Wins If:
- All players become ONI before timer expires
- Last player to be tagged has the longest survival time

#### Results Screen

- **Winner Highlight**: Player with longest survival time
- **Status Display**: Shows if each player escaped or was tagged
- **Statistics Update**: Wins/losses recorded to persistent storage
- **Next Round**: Continue to next round or return to menu

### Statistics Tracking
